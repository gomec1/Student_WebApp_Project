### Project Description

> Our project aims to develop a modern and user-friendly platform that will allow pet owners to find trustworthy and reliable caretakers for their pets. At the same time, it offers pet lovers the opportunity to care for animals while earning pocket money. The platform is designed to create a safe and satisfying environment for all users and to ensure that animals receive continuous care, even when the owner is unable to be present. By fostering a vibrant community, our solution enables users to share experiences and support each other. Our pet sharing platform focuses on making the connection between pet owners and pet lovers simple and effective, with a special emphasis on safety, trustworthiness and user satisfaction.

## How to Use the Project

> This project is designed to be a user-friendly platform for pet owners and pet caretakers. Here's how to use it:

1. **For Pet Owners**: If you're a pet owner looking for a trustworthy caretaker, simply navigate to our website, browse through the list of available caretakers, and choose the one that best fits your needs. You can view their profiles, check their availability, and book their services directly through the platform.

2. **For Pet Caretakers**: If you're an animal lover looking to earn some extra money, you can sign up as a caretaker. Once your profile is set up, pet owners can view your profile and book your services. You'll receive notifications when you have a booking, and you can manage your schedule directly through the platform.

## What was our motivation?

> We initiated this project as part of a school assignment in our Software Engineering module. The goal was to apply theoretical knowledge in a practical setting, enhancing our understanding of real-world software development processes and challenges.

## Why did we build this project?

> We chose to develop this type of website because it offered us the flexibility to incorporate a variety of elements and features, allowing us to explore and implement a wide range of functionalities. This project not only enabled us to address specific user needs effectively but also provided us with a rich learning environment. By integrating diverse technologies and tools, we were able to gain hands-on experience in multiple aspects of web development, from user interface design to complex backend processing. Additionally, this approach allowed us to creatively solve problems and innovate, enhancing our skills in designing scalable and robust software solutions.

## What problem does it solve?

> This project addresses the issue of loneliness among pets by providing a platform where pet owners can find trustworthy caretakers for their animals. Additionally, it offers an opportunity for animal lovers to earn some extra money while spending quality time with pets. This not only helps pets receive the care and attention they need but also assists people in finding flexible, enjoyable employment.

## What did we learn?

> Throughout the project, we gained substantial knowledge and experience. We learned about the integration of various technologies to build a comprehensive application. This includes front-end development with Angular, HTML, CSS, and TypeScript, which taught us about creating interactive and user-friendly web interfaces. On the backend, we explored using Strapi and Insomnia for API development and management, and we deepened our understanding of databases through SQL. This project was a significant opportunity to see how different layers of technology interact within a software ecosystem.

## What makes our project stand out?

> What distinguishes our project is its design and user-friendliness. We focused on creating an intuitive interface that is both aesthetically pleasing and easy to navigate, which significantly enhances the user experience. This attention to design details ensures that our platform is not only functional but also enjoyable to use, setting it apart from other pet care platforms.
